# Hi! Here i will post my PHP projects! 😄

Basically i am training some other languages that i didnt had the opportunity to do in the past👨‍💻


## Lessons Learned

I understood how PHP Syntax actually works using the `$` sign at the start of each variable or expression! 

``` PHP
$name = $_POST['name']; // calling name from a froms in HTML.
echo "Hello, ".$name; // Printing 'name' with echo (standard printing method).
```

For now i am exploring the possibilities of PHP using previous known extensions, libs and frameworks to develop even faster. 

**My Major web applications will be deployed in different repositiores for a organization matter!**
